# ShopFusion - Full Stack E-Commerce Platform

## Project Title
ShopFusion

## Project Overview
ShopFusion is a full-stack e-commerce platform that delivers a complete customer shopping journey and a dedicated admin operations console. The frontend is a React (Vite) single-page app and the backend is a Spring Boot REST API backed by MySQL. Authentication uses JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies, and core flows include catalog browsing, cart management, checkout, payments, order tracking, returns, and customer support.

## Problem Statement
Growing retail teams often juggle separate tools for catalog management, secure checkout, order lifecycle, and post-purchase support. That fragmentation leads to operational bottlenecks and inconsistent customer experiences.

## Solution Description
ShopFusion consolidates customer and admin workflows into a single platform. The customer app focuses on browsing, cart, checkout, and support. The admin console provides catalog management, order operations, customer management, coupon control, analytics, and system settings. A Spring Boot API enforces role-based access, secures sessions via JWT cookies, and coordinates payments via Razorpay or COD.
