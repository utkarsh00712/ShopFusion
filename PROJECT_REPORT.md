# 1. Project Overview

## 1.1 Project Title
ShopFusion

## 1.2 Project Description
ShopFusion is a full-stack e-commerce platform that mirrors real-world shopping operations. Customers can browse products, apply coupons, manage carts, and complete checkout using Razorpay or Cash on Delivery. The system uses JWT authentication stored in HttpOnly cookies and enforces role-based access control for admin features. Admin workflows include catalog management, order processing, coupon control, analytics, support ticketing, and store settings. The backend is built with Spring Boot and persists data in MySQL via JPA/Hibernate.

## 1.3 Problem Statement
Retail teams often lack a unified platform for catalog, checkout, order tracking, and customer support, which creates operational inefficiencies and a fragmented customer experience.

## 1.4 Objective
Build a scalable, secure end-to-end commerce system that includes customer and admin workflows from discovery through post-purchase support.

## 1.5 Target Users
- Online shoppers
- Store administrators and operations teams
- Business owners managing catalog and sales

# 3. System Architecture

## 3.1 Frontend to Backend Communication
The React SPA communicates with the backend via REST APIs. Authenticated requests include cookies for JWT. Admin requests are enforced by a role check in the backend filter.

## 3.2 Backend to Database Interaction
Spring Data JPA repositories map entities to tables and perform CRUD and query-based operations. Transactional flows ensure stock and order consistency.

## 3.3 Overall Application Flow
1. User logs in and receives a JWT cookie
2. Products are fetched via `/api/products`
3. Cart actions are handled via `/api/cart/*`
4. Checkout calculates totals, shipping, tax, and coupon discount
5. Payment is initiated via Razorpay or COD
6. Payment verification confirms order and updates stock
7. User tracks orders and can request returns or refunds

# 6. Database Design

Key tables
- users, jwt_tokens, password_reset_tokens, password_reset_audit
- categories, products, productimages
- cart_items, orders, order_items
- payments, coupons, reviews
- returns, support_tickets, system_settings

Relationships
- One user -> many orders, cart items, support tickets
- One order -> many order_items
- One product -> many productimages, order_items, reviews
- One category -> many products

ER diagram is available in `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`.

# 7. API Documentation

Customer APIs
- `/api/auth/*`, `/api/users/*`, `/api/products/*`, `/api/cart/*`
- `/api/payment/*`, `/api/orders/*`, `/api/support/*`

Admin APIs
- `/admin/dashboard/*`, `/admin/business/*`, `/admin/products/*`
- `/admin/orders/*`, `/admin/users/*`, `/admin/coupons/*`

Full API documentation is in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

# 8. Workflow

1. User logs in and receives JWT cookie
2. Frontend fetches products and categories
3. User adds items to cart; stock is validated
4. Checkout calculates totals using system settings
5. Payment order is created or COD is placed
6. Verification confirms order and updates inventory
7. User tracks orders and can request returns

Workflow diagrams are in `WORKFLOW.md`.

# 13. Interview Preparation

1. Why use JWT with cookies?
HttpOnly cookies reduce token exposure to XSS and simplify session handling.

2. How do you prevent overselling?
Stock is validated on cart operations and again during payment confirmation with row locking.

3. What happens if payment verification fails?
The order is marked failed and payment status is updated accordingly.

4. How are discounts applied?
Coupon validation checks expiry, usage limits, and minimum order amount.

5. How are shipping charges calculated?
Shipping rules are pulled from `system_settings` and applied in PaymentService.

6. How is admin access secured?
A role check in `AuthenticationFilter` blocks non-admins from `/admin` routes.

7. How do return requests work?
Returns are allowed only after delivery and generate support tickets.

8. Why use JPA?
It reduces boilerplate and maps entities to SQL tables cleanly.

9. What are the most important tables?
users, products, orders, order_items, payments, returns.

10. How is payment confirmed?
Razorpay signature verification ensures authenticity.

11. How does the system handle coupons?
Coupons are validated for activity, expiry, and usage limits.

12. How are settings managed?
Settings are stored in `system_settings` and cached in the backend.

13. How is password reset protected?
Captcha, rate limiting, and audit logging are enforced.

14. What would you improve next?
Add background jobs for notifications and robust observability.

15. How is admin visibility ensured?
Admin dashboards and audit logs provide operational insight.

# 14. 30-Second Interview Explanation
ShopFusion is a full-stack e-commerce platform built with React and Spring Boot. It covers the entire shopping lifecycle from product discovery and cart management to checkout and payment via Razorpay or COD. Authentication uses JWT stored in HttpOnly cookies, and admin workflows handle catalog, orders, customers, coupons, and support tickets. The system ensures stock consistency, provides configurable shipping and tax rules, and stores all data in MySQL with JPA.
